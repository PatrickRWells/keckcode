# Jan 27 - Reworked the id_slits algorithm altogether; it might be impossible
# 		to make it *always* work, but this seems to be the most robust
# 		solution so far.
# 	   Updated the find_peaks algorithm on the red side to perform a low
# 	   	order fit to the sky continuum level. I also implemented a
# 	   	clipping routine for the final iteration of the match_lines
# 	   	routine.
# Nov 18 - id_slits tolerances changed to allow robust identification for masks
#		with very long slits and very large gaps
# Sep 24 - id_slits star/slit identification changed to use just the max value
#		for trying to ID the starboxes
# Sep 17 - First public release
