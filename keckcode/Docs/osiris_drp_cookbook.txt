1. open two terminals; type run_odrp in terminal 1 and odrfgui in terminal 2

2. combine all dark frames to a master dark frame.
-choose "add files": add all dark frames
-choose your output path
-choose your output log
-change Reduction templates to "combine_skies_darks"
-push drop DRP in Queue (lower right corner)

3. remove the dark frame
- "clear list" to remove all the files and add all the raw data
-choose your output path
-change the reduction templates to "basic ARP_drfTemplate.xml"
-put the master dark frame in "subtract frame"
-choose the rectification matrices in the "extract Spectra"
-unclick "clean cosmic Rays"
-push drop DRP in Queue (lower right corner)

4. sky subtraction
For example, if there are three frames: frame2, 3, and 4, frame 2 and 4 are at the location A, frame 3 is at the location B (see log)
-choose your output path
-add "scaled sky subtraction" in the left column
-skip (click the skip column) every module except "Scaled Sky Subtraction" and "Save DataSet information"
-choose "add files": add one frame in location A at the top and choose a frame in location B in "Scaled Sky Subtraction"
-push drop DRP in Queue (lower right corner)
-repeat the same procedure until you get all different subtractions (ex: 3-2, 3-4, 2-3, 2-4)
***remember to rename the four subtracted files*

5. mosaic all files
-choose your output path
-choose "add files": add all output files from 4. at the top
-change the reduction templates to "cubes_mosaic_drfTemplate.xml"
-push drop DRP in Queue (lower right corner)
