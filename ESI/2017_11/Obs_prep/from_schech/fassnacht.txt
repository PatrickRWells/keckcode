Dear Chris,

This tarball contains three files:

table1134.pdf: This is taken directly from http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02674
In addition to the relative astrometry and photometry you get a sense
of how challenging the lens is going to be.

Based on griz we estimate z_Q = 3.5.
Based on J-K  we estimate z_L = 1.0.

I go back and forth on whether the best approach is crossed slits or
parallel.  At this instant I favor crossed slits.  We want D to be as
clean as it can be and an AD slit should do well in keeping out light
from B and C.

Slit PAs:

AD: 42.3 WofN or -42.3 EofN
BC: 46.7 EofN

[Calculation: arctan(2.67/2.52) = 46.7 EofN]

Considerations:

1. Frederic is keen to add this to h0licow.

2. We might get lucky and find a strong absorption line system
associated with the lens.

3. This was part of the mid-cycle proposal.  In the meantime emission
line flux ratios would help with the model.

4. The shear is wicked strong.  AD ought to point to a cluster of
galaxies.  With imagination I can see something in the PanSTARRS y and
Vista K.
